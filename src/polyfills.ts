// I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, there was no built-in Angular CLI command to generate a polyfills.ts file. The creation of the polyfills.ts file is typically done manually.

// You can create the polyfills.ts file in your Angular project manually by following these steps:

// Navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal.

// Use a text editor or code editor to create a new file named polyfills.ts in the src folder of your Angular project.

// Inside the polyfills.ts file, you can add the necessary polyfills for your application, depending on the browsers you need to support. Here's a basic example with some common polyfills:

// typescript
// Copy code
/***************************************************************************************************
 * BROWSER POLYFILLS
 */

// This file includes polyfills needed by Angular and is loaded before the app.
// You can add your own extra polyfills to this file.

// Zone.js polyfill for older browsers.
import 'zone.js/dist/zone';

// Add other polyfills as needed for your application here.

import 'zone.js';
